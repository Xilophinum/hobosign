# hobosign
A FiveM implementation of a custom hobo sign text. Player sync and custom fonts

# usage
Just use /hobosign and create the text you would like to appear on the cardboard sign, click save and voila!

# Known Issues
For some strange reason (I am not a modeler), the first time anyone uses a sign, it doesnt render. Why is beyond me. If you figure out why, create a pull request to fix! Will luv you long time.
